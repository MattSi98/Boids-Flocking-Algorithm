# Boids-Flocking-Algorithm
Followed paper by Craig Reynolds and 2D tutorial to create my own 3D flocking simulation in Unity.

I undertook this project to learn the basics of Unity and explore the beauty behind this flocking algorithm.


# Instalation

# -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

First: install unity

Navigate to: Boids-Flocking-Algorithm > Boids > Assets > Scenes

Open Boids.unity

This will open a scene in Unity that when played will begin the flocking simulation.
  - Users can edit the number of animals in each of the three provided flocks (birds, butterflies, and fish).
  
    Simply open the desired flock object in the panel to the left of the screen, and then change the starting count variable slider to the right of the screen.
    
    Users can also change speed and other factors this way, to explore how their alterations change the algorithms performance.
    
      - Default count: butterflies: 360, Birds: 20, fish: 0.
      
  - Users can move the provided obsticles and watch the flocks avoid them.
